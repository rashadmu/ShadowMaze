Game Name: Shadow Maze.

Welcome to Shadow Maze, a simple yet mysterious 2D game I developed during my college days. Built entirely with Java Swing — no fancy game engines, no external libraries — just raw code and late-night debugging sessions.

This was both a learning project and a labor of love, where I dove deep into basic game mechanics, graphics rendering, and UI handling the old-school way.

Feel free to explore, play, or even break it (and hopefully fix it again). 
The source code is open for anyone curious, brave, or bored enough to take a peek!
